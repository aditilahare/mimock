## Overview

Mimock is a utility to setup mocks for REST API endpoints to mimic the response of the actual endpoints. This tool will be helpful for testing UI applications locally or in CI/CD pipelines. Mimock follows an interceptor-based pattern which enables the users to setup and use the mocks in real time without any need for re-deployment.

This project is geared towards both open-source and enterprise applications that offer REST API based solutions. Mimock functions as a faster, easier to set up and automate testing utility tool that can be easily integrated into the deliverables pipeline of various projects.

Mimock is published under the open-source [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Features

Some of the key features offered by the Mimock are as follows

- **Intuitive UI:** Provides an intuitive UI which lets anyone manage mocks without any coding experience.
- **No Re-Deployment:** Mocks can be added in real time, and no application restart is required. Mocks are created and updated on-the-go, which ensures faster development and turn-around time.
- **Access Management:** The platform follows a role-based user management model and the admin can assign roles to the users to setup and restrict their access.
- **Support for multiple response types:** Mimock supports both text and binary response for mocks. So if you want a mock to serve a normal JSON response or a JPEG image file or a PDF document, it can be done in a jiffy.

## Download Options

### JAR with start-up script

Mimock is a Java based application, hence it requires `Java 8+` to run the application. 

- [**Windows**](https://github.com/arbindo/mimock/releases/download/alpha-v0.0.1/mimock-0.0.1.zip)
- [**Linux**](https://github.com/arbindo/mimock/releases/download/alpha-v0.0.1/mimock-0.0.1.tar.gz)
- [**MacOS**](https://github.com/arbindo/mimock/releases/download/alpha-v0.0.1/mimock-0.0.1.tar.gz)

### Docker image

```shell
docker pull mimock/mimock
```

## Setup Instructions

| **Requirements** |
| - |
| Java 8+ |
| PostgreSQL 13+ |

### Run mimock locally

Ensure PostgreSQL is setup with a user and a schema for mimock to automatically complete the required table setup.

`mimock.properties` - The bundle includes the properties file with the required configuration to start mimock. Check the config file and ensure the custom config items are properly setup.

Download the platform-specific bundle from [above]. (#download-options) and run the following command to start mimock.

```shell
java -jar mimock.jar --spring.config.location=./mimock.properties
```

### Run mimock docker container

The [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) has the required setup to spin up PostgreSQL and mimock app containers. The environment variables required for the mimock springboot app are available in the [local.env](local.env) file and the same are referred to in the docker-compose manifest. Update the required env values and run the following command to start mimock

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Run mimock within a k8s cluster

The [mimock-k8s](mimock-k8s) directory has aÂ set of kubernetes manifest files to give an idea of how to setup mimock within a k8s cluster.

### Run mimock on a CI pipeline

A [demo project](https://github.com/arbindo/demo-app) is available on Github, which simulates a scenario of running an UI automation test by setting up mocks using mimock. The project is a simple web application which relies on two endpoints, one for a `json` response and the other for a `webp` image. The mocks for both the endpoints are setup within the workflow and the UI automation script captures the results as snapshots, and publishes the same to the [workflow summary](https://github.com/arbindo/demo-app/actions/runs/2685049363)

### Setup metric collection for mimock

The Prometheus metrics for mimock is exposed on `/api/mimock/monitoring/prometheus`. The [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) file includes the required config for setting up your own prometheus scrapping for mimock
