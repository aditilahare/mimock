## Introduction

Mimock is an utility tool to setup mocks for REST API endpoints to mimic the actual endpoints. This tool will be helpful to test UI applications locally or in CI/CD pipelines. Mimock follows an interceptor based pattern which enables the developer to test the endpoints without having to restart the application.

This project is geared towards both open-source and enterprise applications which offers REST API based solutions. Mimock acts as a faster, easier to setup and automated testing utility tool which can be easily adopted by different projects into their deliverables pipeline.

Mimock is published under open-source [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE).
